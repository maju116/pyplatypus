# The Platypus CV Engine

Overlooking the realms of this Computer Vision framework there is the mighty Engine. It is invoked by the Platypus Solver to deliver
state-of-the-art Computer Vision models, compiled, calibrated and evaluated on the course of processing a bulk payload.

All the engine needs is the YAML config provided by a user, which is validated on the course of parsing through the branching structure
of PlatypusSolverInput.
